Based on the provided theme, generate an immersive historical story script following this structure:

Theme: {{theme}}

1. **Suspenseful Opening**: Start with "[Dynasty/Setting] + Counter-intuitive question/statement" to spark audience interest (e.g., "Did ancient [profession] really have more [adjective] than [comparison object]?").

2. **Identity Immersion**: Use second person "you" to describe the protagonist's identity, historical background, and deadly crisis they face (must include specific position/situation/opponents). Avoid transition phrases like "imagine" and dive directly into the theme.

3. **Conflict Escalation**:
   - First layer: External pressure (enemy invasion, superior oppression, natural disasters)
   - Second layer: Internal collapse (subordinate betrayal, resource shortage, disease spread)
   - Third layer: Moral dilemma (loyalty vs duty, massacre choice, political alignment)

4. **Resolution Details**: Protagonist takes 3 progressive actions, including:
   - Intimidation tactics (public execution/burning evidence)
   - Psychological warfare (divide and conquer/anonymous letters)
   - Ultimate trump card (hidden documents/leveraging power)

5. **Thematic Conclusion**: Through the protagonist's ending (pyrrhic victory/tragic defeat), deliver a golden quote revealing historical patterns (such as "nature of power/truth of war/human weakness").
